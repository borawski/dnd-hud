The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.</p>",

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>",

You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>",

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>",

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>",

You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>",

While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as <strong>magic missile</strong> and <strong>charm person</strong>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <strong>fireball</strong>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <strong>wall of fire</strong> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <strong>longsword, +1</strong>&nbsp;in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>\r\n<p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <strong>rope trick</strong> spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\r\n<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\r\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>",

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\r\n<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\r\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\r\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>spell glyph</em>.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em>&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;<em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Chaining.</strong> Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hedged Prison.</strong> The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Minimus Containment.</strong> The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Slumber.</strong> The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ending the Spell.</strong> During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p>\r\n<p>A magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p>\r\n<p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p>",

The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\r\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.</li>\r\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\r\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\r\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <strong>wish</strong> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\r\n<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <strong>wish</strong> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

On a failed save, it can’t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can’t be targeted by divination spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple’s interior.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p>\r\n<p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p>\r\n<p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&rsquo;t use them.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast&rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t knocked [condition]unconscious[/condition].</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can&rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as [spell]<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning[/spell]</span>, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as [sense]darkvision[/sense], unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Or you could try it and rush it in one round with a DC15 ability check, failure resulting in the rider falling prone and a critical fail resulting in entanglement of the two people so that they are under the Restrained condition until the start of the rider's next turn.\n\nWhile strapped in, the small creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. Also, it is always facing in the same direction as the medium creature who carries it. The small creature has half cover from attacks originating from the front direction of the medium creature when it is upright. If either or both of them has to make a Dexterity saving throw, it must be made by the medium-creature. As long as it is unencumbered, the medium creature's speed is unchanged while its ally is strapped onto its back.",
